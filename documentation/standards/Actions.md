# Onyx Actions

## Summary

Onyx Actions are a way to map some text such as `"weather.temperature"` to a function that completes a task that is semantically related to the text. For example, if the text is `"weather.temperature"`, then the action will return the current temperature in the location specified by the user. The reason this is being documented is because the Interpretation Server will have actions, and the Action server should have the same actions.
