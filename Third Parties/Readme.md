# Onyx Third Parties Server

## Summary

This one is the third party server. It will have endpoints for things like third party APIs, and other third party services. As a central interface for interacting with any third party service, it will be responsible for handling all third party interactions with elegance, efficiency, and security in mind. Seeing as this system is highly personalized, having a central interface for all third parties will be a huge benefit for security. It will also be collecting and sending data to the Onyx Collections Server, so having this abstraction will allow me to easily manage all of the data that is being collected and process it for storage.
