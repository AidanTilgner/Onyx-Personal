# Onyx Images Server

## Summary

This is the central processing service for all things images, including video. It will have endpoints for things like image processing, face detection, face recognition, video gestures, and more. Because it will be handling large amounts of data in the form of images and video, but from relatively few clients, processing speed is valued over memory usage. This will be used not only by client applications, but also by the Onyx Awareness System. Because it will be using a lot of AI models, it will be utilizing languages like python for ease of use, but integration with faster languages like Rust and Go might be essential to speed up it's performance.
