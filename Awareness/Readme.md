# Onyx Awareness Server

## Summary

The Awareness Server is meant to handle constant input from devices and respond to environmental input instead of input directly from the user. This will be used to handle things from the cat's behavior, to security systems. Because of this, it will be centered around taking in multiple streams of data and processing them in order to provide a more accurate representation of the environment. It will be almost entirely user separated, and therefore will not require many things that user centric systems require.
