# Onyx Applications Server

## Summary

The Onyx Applications server is going to act as both the main dashboard for the system, and as a REST API entry point for the system. An application that connects to Onyx will be able to access the main functions of the system through this server. Although an application may choose to use another server for a specific purpose, general purpose requests that utilize the Onyx system as a whole, will usually want to go through here.
